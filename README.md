## Aegis Workload Demo

This is a demo Kubernetes deployment to test Aegis on a cluster.

In this particular case, we leverage [**Aegis Sidecar**][aegis-sidecar] instead
of directly talking to **Safe**. **Aegis Sidecar** abstracts certain cross-cutting
concerns and keep the workload code agnostic about how **Aegis** works internally.

If you want a more finer-grained control, then you can use [Aegis Go SDK][aegis-sdk-go]
and directly access **Aegis Safe**. Check out [this Aegis workload demo 
using a the Go SDK][aegis-demo-sidecar] for an example that leverages
the Aegis Go SDK instead.
